**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
The page is an art gallery project containing the cities of some of Practicum's employees with some info about those places, the goal of this project is to open your mind to different places with the second goal is how we can show this art project across different devices and screen sizes without hurting the beauty of each element on this page.

**Figma**

The project was created according to a design made on Figma. Figma is a tool created for web designers to help them take the idea on their mind and making it a design that web developers can use to write the HTML code to create exactly what the web designer had in mind.

**Technologies**

- The page was fully created with HTML and CSS only, no javascript, to show how versatile they are.
- The page is filled with images, to save space and make the loading faster all of the pictures were compressed, without losing quality.
- To make the page responsive for different screen resolutions the code is filled with tools to make it more responsive: Media Queries, The calc() function, Usage of % and vw instead of fixed sizes, etc.
- Just like a true art gallery the placement of the pictures matter, for that the grid is used to control the position of several items at once and relative to each other.
- Font Smoothing, a tool that helps make fonts more attractive and consistent across different.
